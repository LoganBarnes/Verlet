# Verlet

#### Overview

Verlet started as a final project for Brown University's ***CS1972: 3D Game Engines*** course by Vivian Wu, Veena Vignale, and Logan Barnes. Verlet is a multi-platform, art driven game created with a custom C++/OpenGL engine. The core mechanic involves cloth manipulation made possible through the use of [position based dynamics](http://matthias-mueller-fischer.ch/publications/posBasedDyn.pdf) and [verlet integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration).

#### Technical Features
**Multiplatform** - The game utilizes the Qt Framework allowing it to be run on OS X, Linux, and Windows.

**Real-time Cloth Physics** - The custom made verlet integration engine allows for real-time movement, collisions, and tearing.

**Modern OpenGL** - Using the newer OpenGL API's allows for more control and speed over graphics effects such as:
 - Deferred Lighting
 - Participating Media (fog)
 - Particles

**Original Style/Sound** - The game objects, look, and music were designed to complement one another and immerse the player in the game world.
