It's a game. Play it.

WASD + space to move
Right mouse button + drag to change camera angle 

Lighting/ fog:
1 to toggle fog

Verlet:
Left mouse button + drag to move selected point << This looks really cool, do it 

If you have headphones, there is sound!

Can't guarantee you won't fall through the world or that WASD might not work too well.
