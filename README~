README

vhwu
Collisions: aside from the case when the player is colliding geometrically + verlet is frozen, collisions are working- verletManager’s collideTerrain() 
Tearing: not really part of the requirements, but also implemented this week- triangleMesh’s tearLink()

vvignale
Lighting: all three shaders are set up and fully functional (light pass, geometry pass, final pass)
Fog: fog shader
Can see them being called in GameWorld, onDraw()
Graphics: renderLightShape() - renders the lights

ltbarnes
GPU verlet integration: in progress
Everything is in the sound/audio.cpp 
common/wavreader
PosPan sound
Distance attenuation
Stereo support

Bugs:
Tearing causes crashing occasionally
